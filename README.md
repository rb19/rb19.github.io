# LJLRC Bracket Generator
A bracket generator for the [Lincoln Johnny Lightning Race Club (LJLRC)](http://www.ljlrc.com/), a local diecast race club that meets once a month for gravity 2-lane and 4-lane racing. This bracket generator takes a CSV file containing player names and the number of cars competing for a race class as the input. The generator returns brackets of 16 slots each as pages, and returns as many pages needed to set up the race. This is meant to reduce that would be a manual process that takes hours down to a few minutes, with the bracket generation itself taking less than a second.
